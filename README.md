A collection of Python functions for performing geospatial analysis and creating visualisations.

A Python library for geospatial data processing, map matching, and OSM-based geometry handling. This library provides efficient geospatial indexing, geometry manipulations, and various utilities to work with OpenStreetMap data.

## Features

- Convert OpenStreetMap (OSM) way IDs to geometries.
- Decode polylines to latitude/longitude coordinates.
- Perform map-matching using different services (e.g., OSRM).
- Utilities for working with OSM geometries.
- Fast intersection methods for spatial data analysis.

# Geospatial Indexing Tools

This repository provides a set of tools for efficient geospatial indexing and spatial analysis using widely adopted spatial indexing systems such as **Geohash**, **S2**, and **H3**. These tools allow converting geometries into spatial cells, compacting/uncompacting cells, and performing various spatial operations, optimized for performance with parallel processing capabilities.

## Features

- **Convert Geometries to Spatial Cells**: Easily convert geometries (e.g., Polygons, MultiPolygons) to spatial cells in formats like Geohash, S2, or H3.
- **Parallelized Processing**: Process large datasets in parallel to speed up cell generation from geometries.
- **Cell Operations**: Compact, uncompact, and convert spatial cells back to their geometrical form.
- **Customizable Resolutions**: Define the resolution level to control the granularity of spatial cells.
- **Spatial Statistics**: Compute H3 cell statistics like cell coverage and area for given geometries.

## Supported Indexing Systems

- **Geohash**: Divides the Earth's surface into a grid of hierarchical geohashes.
- **S2**: A spherical geometry system that partitions the globe into hierarchical cells.
- **H3**: A hexagonal grid system used for efficient spatial operations.

## Installation

Ensure the following dependencies are installed:

```bash
pip install geopandas shapely h3-py s2sphere
